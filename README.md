# Arrays
Question 1: Remove Even Integers From Array
  Time complexity:O(n) because the input array is traversed once, where n is the number of elements in the array.
  Space complexity: O(1) because no extra space is used.
  
Question 2: Merge Two Sorted Arrays
  Time Complexity: O(m+n).
  Space Complexity: O(m+n).
